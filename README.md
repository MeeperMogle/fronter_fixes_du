This script was made by and for students of the programme Digitalbrott och eSäkerhet.

It is possible for students of other programmes/courses to use it as well, however you will most likely need to add your own course-names to the list manually by either adding your courses or replacing the existing ones with your own. Your changes will not affect other users.

The order of the list of courses doesn't matter, but they are currently sorted by Digitalbrott och eSäkerhet start-semesters.
